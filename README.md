# Free Educational Resource During Corona Epidemia

Hi!
This is a repository meant to serve as a place where people can update and write information and spread links to websites and organizations offering temporary or permanent access to premium content for intended purposes of self learning and self-education.

This is not a repository to contain solely programming or computer science related areas, but to categorize and generalize into other fields, interests and hobbies as well.

With millions of people around the globe staying close to home to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19, access to books and information is more important than ever before. So, for the next month, we will be making Scribd’s library — which includes millions of ebooks, audiobooks, magazine articles, and more — available to anyone, free, for 30 days. There is no credit card or commitment required. Our goal is simply to ensure everyone has access to their favorite books, authors, and quality content as we settle into our new normal for the next few weeks.

## [365DataScience](https://365datascience.com/pricing/)

- Hi all,
Like the rest of the world, all of us at 365 Data Science are concerned about the novel Coronavirus outbreak and the impact it is having on so many lives. With people staying at home and universities closing their doors in an effort to contain the virus, online education is more vital than ever for people to maintain and develop their knowledge and skills.
For this reason, we have decided to make the entire 365 Data Science Online Program free until April 15, 2020.
As you know, 365 Data Science is a subscription-based educational platform for aspiring data scientists. For the first time since our founding, we’re unlocking all our content; 21 courses, 100 hours of video instruction and 600+ exercises entirely for free. We hope this will help aspiring data scientists pursue their studies and also contribute to the well-being of our global community during this challenging time.
As a registered student, you have automatically received the free upgrade to the full program.
To access all courses, just log in into your your account at 365datascience.teachable.com
We are glad to be of service to our community and invite you to share this information with anyone who might benefit from this opportunity.
Stay at home and keep learning,
Ned and Iliya
Co-founders
